Buzz Bombers Game Description (Key Points)





🕹️ Game Overview: Buzz Bombers is a 1982 fixed shooter game by Mattel Electronics for the Intellivision, inspired by Atari’s Centipede.



🌸 Objective: Control a bug spray can to protect a garden of flowers from swarms of bees.



🐝 Gameplay Mechanics: Shoot bee repellent to turn bees into honeycombs, which block paths and cause bees to drop closer to the garden upon collision or reaching the screen’s edge.



🐝 Bee Types: Worker bees move predictably left and right; killer bees (introduced later) move faster, ignore honeycombs, and form red honeycombs when hit.



🐦 Hummingbird Ally: A hummingbird eats honeycombs for bonus points but turns green and leaves if sprayed too much.



🌷 Challenge: Bees pollinate flowers upon reaching the ground, causing them to grow and limit the spray can’s movement.



💨 Resources: Start with three spray cans, each with 56 sprays; earn bonus cans at 20,000, 40,000, and every 80,000 points.



🎮 Game Over: The game ends when all spray cans are depleted.



🎶 Soundtrack: Features "Flight of the Bumblebee," though the music can feel repetitive.



📦 Production Notes: Faced packaging errors fixed by hand and a failed promotional tie-in with Raid insecticide.



⭐ Reception: Offers quirky charm and strategic depth but may lose appeal due to repetitive music and occasionally sluggish controls.



📀 Legacy: Included in the Intellivision Lives! collection.
